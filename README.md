# Grokking Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to applying the knowledge acquired from the book Grokking Algorithms. To practice, I have chosen three programming languages: 
- Java
- Golang
- TypeScript
<hr/>
I will organize the directories at the end of my studies. For now, since I will be using TypeScript and implementing tests for some challenges, I decided to add the configuration in the root path.

This project's workflow on Git will be organized as follows:
- There will be a main branch and a dev branch.
- The dev branch will be used to merge each activity from each chapter in the respective language, with the branch name formatted as chapter{number}#{programmingLanguage}.
- At the end of each chapter, I will merge the dev branch into the main branch.
