# Grokking Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to applying the knowledge acquired from the book Grokking Algorithms. To practice, I have chosen three programming languages: Java, Golang, and TypeScript.

I will organize the directories at the end of my studies. For now, since I will be using TypeScript and implementing tests for some challenges, I decided to add the configuration in the root path.
